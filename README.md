## RTTTL Player


</div>

### Description

This allows you to play RTTTL (ringtones) through the PC speaker. It calculates each frequency and length, and plays it using the beep API function. For this reason, it doesn't work under Win9x...

The zip contains two projects. The RTTTLr is a standalone program that plays the tones based upon RTTTL you enter in a textbox. The RTTTLDLL is an extivex exe that allows you to pmay RTTTL from your own application, on it's own thread, so it won't freeze your application while playing.
